## Task 1
Create a classification model in Python. Feel free to use libraries such as SkLearn, Keras/Tensorflow or Pytorch. 
Analyse the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
Develop some form of plot or graph with brief comments on your observations.
